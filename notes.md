## learning about wn

The 'publish' button just console logs the input --
https://github.com/fission-suite/blog/blob/develop/src/pages/Editor.tsx#L18

Where would the input go in real life?

My guess is that you use the `webnative` module to `fs.write` the blog post
somewhere.

-----------------------------------------

The `Posts.tsx` file logs `console.log("âœ… feed file exists")` when I start the
app. What is the feed file and where is it?

The `fs` here is the webnative module.
```js
  // src/pages/Posts.tsx
  const { fs, username } = useWebnative();
```

Likewise, uploading a photo would be a matter of `fs.write`ing an image blob.

---------------------------------------------------

So, that's a lot of state that is implied when using the `webnative` module.
Where does `fs` read from?

In `Posts.tsx`, we call fs.exists on a feedPath. The feedPath comes from
```js
const feedPath = fs.appPath(wn.path.file("feed.json"));
```

https://github.com/fission-suite/webnative#web-native-file-system

```js
// List the user's private files that belong to this app
await fs.ls(fs.appPath())
```

```js
// Create a sub directory and add some content
await fs.write( fs.appPath(wn.path.file("Sub Directory", "hello.txt")), "ðŸ‘‹" )
```

So `fs.appPath` returns a path to this app's files.

------------------------------------------------------

From what I've read so far...
`webnative` seems to keep a merkle-dag of file-like data.

Where does it store the actual files? I assume `webnative` has some kind of
synchronization built in, so you could have a local copy + multiple remotes,
like git.
